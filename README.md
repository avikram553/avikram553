# Hey, I'm Aditya 👋

### AI Engineer | LLM Developer | Building intelligent systems that actually work

Currently pursuing my Master's in Web Engineering at TU Chemnitz while researching semantic AI with Llama 3.1. Previously spent 3.7 years at Bosch building production ML systems for automotive diagnostics and AI-powered developer tools. I enjoy turning research papers into working code and building AI applications that solve real problems.
